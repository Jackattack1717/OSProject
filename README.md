# OS Project

## Introduction
I've started work on this operating system and intend on writing it in such a way as a learning tool for myself.
My plan is to create an terminal-based OS with *absolutely zero intention* of running on bare metal. If it is able to, that is a nice bonus. My plan for this is to write the OS in a clear and easy to understand fashion, with references to the learning materials I have access to. Those of which include:
* The OS dev Wiki
* Operating Systems: from 0 to 1 PDF
	* Available for free online
and others.

## Installation
Make sure you have the [requirements](requirements.txt) installed before attempting to run the operating system.
* **make** creates the disk img that you can use anywhere
* **make run** creates the disk and autolaunches qemu with the appropriate settings
* **make debug** creates the disk and launches qemu in debug mode with GDB connected via port 26000
